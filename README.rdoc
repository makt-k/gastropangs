"Should we stop eating when we are no longer hungry or until we are full?"
A project aimed to cultivate a shift in how we think about hunger and fullness, allowing users to stay conscious of their eating habits and alert them to possible red flags in their consumption patterns.

There is limited testing as this project was completed in less than a week. Feel free to contact me if you hit any bugs!
